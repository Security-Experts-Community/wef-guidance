# Group Policy Objects

Group policy objects (GPO), provided with this repository, contain only some set of recommended settings for Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) and Windows Event Collector (WEC), as this project currently covers only those topics. Audit polices and WinRM settings are out of scope of this project at this time. Provided recommendations should obly be taken as advice, and should be custom-tailored for your own environment.
